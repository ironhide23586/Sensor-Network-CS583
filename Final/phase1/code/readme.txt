Python 2.7 programming language has been used to implement the project.

This folder contains the main python file named "Phase1.py". The folder skeleton structure necessary for program execution has already been laid out (empty folder titled "results"(containing 2 empty folders) and folder containing data files titled "intelLabDataProcessed") which should not be modified.

To run the program, simply execute Phase1.py

The packages used are -
-csv: For reading and writing CSV files
-matplotlib: For plotting histograms
-numpy: For performing numerically complex computations
-copy: For creating deep copies of python objects
-sklearn: More precisely, only the method "mean_absolute_error" from sklearn.metrics has been used to compute the mean absolute errors of the predictions
